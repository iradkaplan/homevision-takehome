## Running in production

A terrible idea! Don't do it! To make this app ready for production would require, at a bare minimum, adding authentication, TLS, and unit tests, and the name/userId would need to be a secret token that would be sent with each request. And there are probably other things it needs to. It wasn't meant for that.
